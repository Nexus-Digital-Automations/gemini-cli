 * Infinite Loop Detection and Prevention Test Suite

 * Critical safety tests to ensure the task management system cannot
 * enter infinite loops or unbounded recursive operations that could
 * crash or hang the system.
 *
 * Safety mechanisms tested:
 * - Circular dependency detection
 * - Recursive operation limits
 * - Runaway process prevention
 * - Memory leak protection
 * - Timeout enforcement
