## Project Overview

Gemini CLI is an open-source AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly into your terminal. The project consists of:

- **Multi-package architecture**: CLI frontend, Core backend, Extensions, Tools
- **Advanced task management**: Autonomous task management system with feature workflow
- **Comprehensive tooling**: Built-in tools for file operations, shell commands, web fetching
- **Extensibility**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for custom integrations
- **Enterprise features**: Security, monitoring, deployment options

## Key Features

- 🎯 Free tier with 60 requests/min and 1,000 requests/day
- 🧠 Powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro with 1M token context window
- 🔧 Built-in tools: Google Search grounding, file operations, shell commands
- 🔌 Extensible via MCP servers
- 💻 Terminal-first design for developers
- 🛡️ Open source (Apache 2.0)

## Architecture Highlights

- **Modular Design**: Separation of CLI frontend and Core backend
- **Tool System**: Extensible tool architecture for environment interaction
- **Authentication**: Multiple auth methods (OAuth, API key, Vertex AI)
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration system with project-specific settings
- **Autonomous Task Management**: Self-managing task queue with validation cycles

## Development Principles

1. **User-Centric**: Focus on developer experience and productivity
2. **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns
3. **Extensibility**: Support for community plugins and extensions
4. **Quality**: Comprehensive testing and validation
5. **Security**: Security-first approach with audit trails
6. **Performance**: Efficient token usage and response times
