   # List available methods
   timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" methods
   ```

## Feature Lifecycle Management

### Understanding the Feature Workflow

```
suggest → approve → implement → track
```

1. **Suggested**: Initial feature idea requiring approval
2. **Approved**: Feature approved for implementation
3. **Rejected**: Feature declined with documented reason
4. **Implemented**: Feature successfully completed

### Creating Feature Suggestions

#### Basic Feature Suggestion

```bash
node taskmanager-api.js suggest-feature '{

## Agent Coordination

### Understanding Agent Roles

The system supports specialized agent roles for optimal task distribution:

- **Frontend Agents**: UI/UX development, styling, component creation
- **Backend Agents**: API development, database operations, server logic
- **Testing Agents**: Test creation, validation, quality assurance
- **Documentation Agents**: Technical writing, API documentation, user guides
- **Security Agents**: Security analysis, vulnerability assessment, compliance
- **Performance Agents**: Optimization, profiling, scalability analysis
- **Architecture Agents**: System design, code organization, technical decisions

### Agent Initialization Patterns

#### Single Agent for Simple Tasks

```bash
# Initialize for basic operations
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" initialize SIMPLE_TASK_AGENT
```

#### Coordinated Multi-Agent Deployment

```bash
# Initialize multiple specialized agents
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" initialize FRONTEND_AGENT_01
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" initialize BACKEND_AGENT_01
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" initialize TESTING_AGENT_01
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" initialize DOCS_AGENT_01
```

#### Agent Reinitialization for Session Continuity

```bash
# Reinitialize existing agent for new session
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" reinitialize FRONTEND_AGENT_01
```

### Deployment Strategies

#### Minimum Viable Deployment (3 Agents)

For moderate complexity tasks:

```bash
# Core development triad
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" initialize DEV_AGENT_01
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" initialize TEST_AGENT_01
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" initialize VALIDATION_AGENT_01
```

#### Standard Deployment (5-7 Agents)

For complex feature development:

```bash
# Comprehensive development team
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" initialize ARCHITECTURE_AGENT
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" initialize FRONTEND_DEV_AGENT

```

## Task Completion and Quality Gates

### Self-Authorization Protocol

Agents can authorize their own completion when all quality criteria are met:

```bash
# Authorize stop when project achieves perfection
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" authorize-stop AGENT_ID "All TodoWrite tasks complete and project perfect: linter✅ build✅ start✅ tests✅"
```

### Quality Validation Checklist

Before authorizing completion, verify:

1. **Code Quality**

   ```bash
   # Linting passes with zero errors/warnings
   npm run lint

   # TypeScript compilation successful
   npm run typecheck
   ```

2. **Build Process**

   ```bash
   # Project builds successfully
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Runtime Verification**

   ```bash
   # Application starts without errors
   npm run start
   ```

4. **Test Validation**

   ```bash
   # All tests pass with adequate coverage
   npm test
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

5. **Documentation Completeness**
   - All public APIs documented
   - User guides updated
   - README reflects current state
   - Architecture decisions recorded

6. **Security Compliance**
   ```bash
   # Security scans pass
   npm audit
   semgrep --config=p/security-audit .
   ```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### System Health Monitoring

#### Initialization Statistics

```bash
# Get detailed usage analytics
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" get-initialization-stats
```

**Understanding Time Buckets:**

- 5-hour time periods with daily advancing start times
- Today starts at 8am, tomorrow at 9am, etc.
- Tracks initialization and reinitialization patterns
- Historical data maintained for 30 days

#### Real-Time Agent Status

Monitor active agents and their sessions:

- **Active Agents**: Currently operational agents
- **Session IDs**: Unique identifiers for each agent session
- **Heartbeat Tracking**: Last activity timestamp for each agent
- **Previous Sessions**: Historical session data for continuity

### Performance Monitoring

#### Response Time Tracking

- All operations timeout at 10 seconds
- Sub-second response for most operations
- File locking prevents race conditions
- Atomic operations ensure data integrity

#### Resource Usage Optimization

- Memory-efficient for large feature sets
- Concurrent agent support
- Optimized file I/O operations
- Minimal system footprint

## Best Practices

### Feature Management Best Practices

1. **Clear Feature Titles**: Use descriptive, actionable titles (10-200 characters)
2. **Comprehensive Descriptions**: Include technical details and user impact (20-2000 characters)
3. **Business Justification**: Always include clear business value proposition (10-1000 characters)
4. **Appropriate Categorization**: Choose correct category for proper organization
5. **Regular Review Cycles**: Periodically review and approve/reject suggested features

### Agent Coordination Best Practices

1. **Right-Size Deployments**: Match agent count to task complexity
2. **Clear Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive agent IDs for easy identification
3. **Specialized Roles**: Assign agents to their areas of expertise
4. **Session Continuity**: Reinitialize agents for seamless session continuation
5. **Quality First**: Never skip quality validation steps

### Operational Best Practices

1. **Timeout Compliance**: Always use 10-second timeouts for API calls
2. **Error Handling**: Monitor API responses and handle errors gracefully
3. **Data Backup**: Regularly backup FEATURES.json and project state
4. **Documentation**: Keep operational procedures documented and current
5. **Security**: Follow security protocols for sensitive operations

## Common Workflows

### Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Reinitialize your main agent
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" reinitialize MAIN_DEV_AGENT

# 2. Check feature status

# 5. Authorize completion when done
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" authorize-stop MAIN_DEV_AGENT "Daily development cycle complete"
```

### Feature Planning Session

```bash
# 1. Suggest multiple features
node taskmanager-api.js suggest-feature '{...feature1...}'

timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" initialize ESTIMATION_AGENT

# 2. Review approved features for sprint
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" list-features '{"status":"approved"}'

# 3. Deploy implementation team based on feature complexity
# (3-10 agents based on sprint scope)

# 4. Monitor progress throughout sprint
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" get-initialization-stats
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Agent Initialization Fails**
   - Verify Node.js version (18+)
   - Check file system permissions
   - Ensure TaskManager API is accessible

2. **Feature Approval Blocked**
   - Verify feature is in "suggested" status
   - Check feature ID exists
   - Validate approval data format

3. **Quality Gates Failing**
   - Run linter and fix all issues
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Verify build process completes
